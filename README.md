### BSidesBNE CTF Challenge Submission Template
For challenges this year, we'll be making use of [ctfcli](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli) to make our life as CTF admins better. In order to do this, we'd like authors to provide a `challenge.yml` file which details the necessary metadata about the challenge, and a `healthcheck.py` file (where healthcheck's are appropriate). Details about what can be specified in the `challenge.yml` file is documented in the [YAML Challenge spec](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli/blob/master/ctfcli/spec/challenge-example.yml).

* `src/` should contain the source files/code for your challenge.
* `dist/` should contain any files which will be published to the CTFd Board for challengers to see. 

### How To Submit?
Once you have completed your challenge, get in contact with `nomad#7792` via Discord. We will create a private github repository for you to submit your challenge through, and if it is accepted it will be merged into our main challenges repo!
